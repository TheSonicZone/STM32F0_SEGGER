# STM32F0_SEGGER
A Project to evaluate SEGGER Embedded Studio for STM32

## Rationale
STM32CubeIDE kind of sucks, it's slow, it's a behemoth of template code and macros
This is an evaluation of SEGGER's tools and this project demonstrates how easy it was
to create a working application in minutes for the STM32F0 Discovery Board

## Usage
This is a template for further use by me, it debugs incredibly fast with the stock ST-LINK V2
